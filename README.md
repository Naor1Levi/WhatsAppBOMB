# WhatsAppBOMB
Send multiple messages to single Whatsapp user with proxy & multiprocessing

this "bomb" works with selenium web driver so you will need an actual phone to work with.
for more afficiant attack use more than one phone, also to add more phones to the attack you need to
set a proxies in the proxylist.txt file <br>
example: if you have 3 proxies you should have 3 phones this is how my script works.

if you want to attack with only one phone you should have 1 proxy in the "proxylist" file.<br>
to make this script work you must have at least one proxy!
